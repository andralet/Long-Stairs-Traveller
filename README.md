# Long-Stairs-Traveller

Program for Long Stairs map generation. Prints some inspiration for DM as well.

Maps are generated in JSON format to be rendered via deepnight.net map generator (see https://deepnight.net/tools/rpg-map/).

I've done this thing mostly for personal use but it's pretty simple, so you won't have much trouble figuring out how it works.

NOTICE:
Texts are done in Russian, because my players know it better (and because I'm too lazy to make translations for everything).
Some troubles shall have 18+ mark (e.g. a requirement to sing obscene songs in some rooms). Better modify them, if you want to play with children. And don't say I didn't warn you!
