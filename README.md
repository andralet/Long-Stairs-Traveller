# Long-Stairs-Traveller

Program for Long Stairs map generation. Prints some inspiration for DM as well.

Maps are generated in JSON format to be rendered via deepnight.net map generator (see https://deepnight.net/tools/rpg-map/).

I've done this thing mostly for personal use but it's pretty simple, so you won't have much trouble figuring out how it works.
